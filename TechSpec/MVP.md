# MVP Implementation Plan

## Day 1-2 (Core Framework)
### Objective:
Establish the foundational framework of the game, including core player functionality and map integration.

### Tasks:
- Implement **GameManager** (P0):
  - Manage game state transitions (`startGame()`, `endGame(winner)`, `updateGame()`).
  - Assign roles (`assignRoles()`) and check victory conditions (`checkVictoryConditions()`).
- Implement **Player (Base Class)** (P0):
  - Create base attributes (`name`, `role`, `health`, `inventory`, `position`, `speed`).
  - Implement core methods:
    - `move(int direction)` for movement.
    - `interact()` for environmental interactions.
    - `pickUpItem(item)` for inventory handling.
- Implement **Map** (P0):
  - Define the static layout of the map with rooms and entrances.
  - Add movement between rooms (`movePlayerToRoom(player, room)`).

---

## Day 3-4 (Essential Features)
### Objective:
Add the core functionality for students, teachers, and interactables.

### Tasks:
- Implement **Student** (P0):
  - Add methods:
    - `alertEscape()` to notify players when they can win.
    - `craft(item[])` for creating new items using inventory.
- Implement **Teacher** (P0):
  - Add methods:
    - `catchStudent(student)` for identifying rule-breaking players.
    - `confiscateItem(item)` for removing forbidden items.
- Implement **Interactable** (P1):
  - Add variables (`type`, `location`) and methods (`activate()`, `onInteract(player, type)`).
  - Define basic interaction logic for key objects (e.g., doors, desks).
- Implement **Item** (P1):
  - Add variables:
    - `name` for item identification.
    - `allowed` for defining contraband status.
  - Enable item interactions within player inventory.

---

## Day 5 (Enhancement & Testing)
### Objective:
Integrate UI features, event handling, and finalize testing.

### Tasks:
- Implement **UIManager** (P1):
  - Display player health (`updateHealthBar(player)`).
  - Show inventory contents (`updateInventory(player)`).
- Implement **EventManager** (P1):
  - Add custom event logic (`triggerCustomEvent(event)`).
  - Set up basic disaster scenarios (e.g., fire, power outage).
- Conduct final testing:
  - Verify role assignment and victory conditions.
  - Test player interactions with map, items, and each other.
  - Ensure basic UI and event triggers function as expected.

### Stretch Goals (if time permits):
- Add additional room features using **Room** (P1):
  - Implement `getCorners()` for room corner data.
- Refine and expand **Interactable** functionality (e.g., animations for object interactions).
